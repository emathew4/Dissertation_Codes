1. Open Terminal, activate venv

	source /Users/ethanmathew/PycharmProjects/dipytesting/venv/bin/activate

2. Start python, add project path
	
	python3.9

	import sys; sys.path.extend(['/Users/ethanmathew/PycharmProjects/dipytesting'])

	# can see necessary commands at top of Python Console in Pycharm if needed

3. Import dki_runner, set vars, run analysis

	# Same as you would in Pycharm

	import dki_runner

	base='full/path/to/base/'	# include slash at end (or modify dki_runner)
	
	output='full/path/to/output/folder

Then choose from 
	
	dki_runner.run_dipy(base,output,'both')		# no preprocessing, just analysis
	dki_runner.run_dipy(base,output,'',False)		# just preprocessing, no analysis
	dki_runner.run_dipy(base,output,'both',False)	# preprocessing, then analysis

NB: for Philips, the data comes as int16. Can save the output data as int16 to keep standard, or can save the output as float32, but check to make sure data range of saved output hasn't changed
