# Dissertation_Codes

This repository contains code for the various projects presented in my dissertation. The "general" folder contains code for basic image viewing, data struct manipulation, and plotting (boxplots and violin plots). The "dipy_fitting" folder contains python code for conducting DTI and DKI tensor fitting, along with a text file with instructions on how to run the code. 

The other folders contain code designed for each project, with scripts for data conversion, image registration, ROI value extraction, and statistical analysis. Additional code for project-specific processing/visualization are also included (e.g. bulbar_checkmotion.m in "bulbar_repeatability"). The "preclin" folder is also split between histology related functions and MR imaging related functions, with the MR imaging folder broken down further into directories for image registration, diffusion analysis, TRATE analysis, and plotting of the final results.
